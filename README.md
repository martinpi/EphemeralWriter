# EphemeralWriter
A web-based editor for Ephemeral Writing

## What is this tool for?
Ephemerald is a tool for writing procedural text. It is a nicer interface to a tool called Tracery with the goal of making procedural text generation available to non-programmers in a super streamlined form. Ephmeral Writing was created by Martin Pichlmair.

What does it do? It allows you to procedurally generate text. You can use that text to feed twitter bots, to create SVG images, to name your child or for any other purpose where you want to have varied, partially randomised text.

How does it do that? You, the writer, provide text that has blank spaces. Then you provide different snippets of text to go into those blank spaces. The software randomly selects pieces every time you tell it to. That way your text varies over time.
